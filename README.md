A generic dice roller for Forged in the Dark games in FoundryVTT, based on code by Megastruktur

## Usage

Use the FD icon at the bottom of the taskbar.<br>
Pick your dice pool, position, and effect, then roll.<br>

OR

Use the shortcut key to bring up the dialog, set to 'R' by default.

## Settings

There are module settings for controlling:<br>
- the max number of dice<br>
- the default number of dice initially selected<br>
- the default position initially selected<br>
- the default effect initially selected<br>
- the new GUI interface (per user setting)<br>

## Macro usage

You can now set up macros and skip the popup UI altogether (Thanks to Thune#3566 for this idea and the idea for the entire module!)<br>

`game.fitdroller.FitDRoller("attribute", dice, "position", "effect")<br>`

`attribute` = can be any string (defaults to "")<br>
`dice` = total number of dice to roll (defaults to 0)<br>
`position` = either controlled, risky, or desperate (defaults to risky if you enter anything else)<br>
`effect` = either great, standard, or limited (defaults to standard if you enter anything else)<br>

If you want to make a Fortune roll (no position or effect), set the `attribute` to fortune.

You can also trigger the Dialog using `game.fitdroller.FitDRollerPopup()`

## New GUI

A new GUI has been contributed by Mestre Digital and Gus, allowing for rolls with fewer clicks.<br>
